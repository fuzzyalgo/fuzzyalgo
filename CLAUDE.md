Instructions for Claude Code when working in this repository.

## Compiling MQL5 scripts (FuzzyAlgo)

FuzzyAlgo source lives under `MetaTrader5_TMPL/MQL5/`:
- `MQL5/Include/FuzzyAlgo/` — shared headers (`.mqh`)
- `MQL5/Scripts/FuzzyAlgo/` — scripts (`.mq5`) and their compiled output (`.ex5`)

The compiler (`MetaEditor64.exe`) is not committed as an exe — it ships zipped at
`MetaTrader5_TMPL/metaeditor64.zip`. Extract it once into `MetaTrader5_TMPL/` before compiling:

```bash
cd MetaTrader5_TMPL
unzip -o metaeditor64.zip -d .
```

### Compile command

Run from `MetaTrader5_TMPL/` (paths are relative to this working directory).
`/include:` must point at `MQL5` itself — MetaEditor appends `Include\...` internally,
so passing `MQL5\Include` doubles the path and every include fails with error 106.

```bash
cd MetaTrader5_TMPL
./MetaEditor64.exe /compile:"MQL5\Scripts\FuzzyAlgo\<Script>.mq5" /include:"MQL5" /log:"C:\fuzzyalgo\logs\compile_<script>.log"
```

Example — compiling both test scripts:

```bash
cd MetaTrader5_TMPL
./MetaEditor64.exe /compile:"MQL5\Scripts\FuzzyAlgo\TestVariables.mq5" /include:"MQL5" /log:"C:\fuzzyalgo\logs\compile_testvariables.log"
./MetaEditor64.exe /compile:"MQL5\Scripts\FuzzyAlgo\TestFFT.mq5" /include:"MQL5" /log:"C:\fuzzyalgo\logs\compile_testfft.log"
```

### Logs

- Always write compiler logs to `C:\fuzzyalgo\logs\` (a sibling of this repo, **outside**
  `fuzzyalgo/`) — never inside the repo tree, so build artifacts don't get committed.
- Log files are UTF-16LE. Convert before reading: `iconv -f UTF-16LE -t UTF-8 <file>`.
- Check the last few lines for the `Result: N errors, N warnings` summary.

### Notes

- Successful compilation overwrites the corresponding `.ex5` binary next to the `.mq5`
  source (e.g. `TestVariables.ex5`), which is tracked in git — expect it to show as
  modified after a successful build even with no source changes (rebuild timestamps).
- `MetaEditor64.exe` and `*.zip` binaries should stay untracked/ignored; don't commit them.

## Running the MetaTrader terminal (RUN.ps1)

`MetaTrader5_TMPL/RUN.ps1` starts `terminal64.exe`. Run it from `MetaTrader5_TMPL/`:

```bash
powershell.exe -file RUN.ps1
```

- Credentials (`--login`/`--password`/`--server`) are only required **once**, to create
  `config/common.ini`. The user typically does this initial run themselves since it
  involves a password.
- Once `config/common.ini` exists, run with **no arguments** (or `--login=` /
  `--profile=` only) — it reuses the existing config and just launches the terminal.
  This is the form Claude should use.
- Passing `--password` again regenerates `common.ini` — don't do this unless the user
  explicitly asks to change credentials.
- `config/common.ini` is gitignored (contains the password in plaintext) — never cat
  it out or commit it.

## Known open issues (TestVariables.mq5)

- **`SumPosvsSumNeg` ratio spikes near zero-crossings** — e.g. `S900` showed `-2809.4`
  in a live log. The function (in `TestVariables.mq5`) substitutes `1`/`-1` when a
  denominator is exactly `0`, but doesn't guard against a *near*-zero denominator, so
  the ratio can blow up. Not a bug introduced by the `PrintSampleInfo` refactor — it's
  inherent to the formula and only became visible once all configured periods started
  printing. If logic gets built on top of this ratio, consider clamping or a bounded
  transform (e.g. a log-ratio) first.
- **EURUSD `sRefPoint`/`CopyTicks` intermittently returns 0 results** — seen as
  `XX EURUSD ... price: 0.00000` while other symbols (EURGBP/GBPJPY/NZDUSD) succeeded
  (`OK ...`) in the same run; in other runs EURUSD came back `OK`, so it's intermittent,
  not constant. Corrupts the `c0_ref`-based delta column for EURUSD when it happens. If
  reported again, check `sRefPoint`'s `CopyTicks` call/retry logic in
  `MQL5/Include/FuzzyAlgo/variables.mqh` first.
